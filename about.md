I am a Data Analyst who loves to learn and creatively express herself. I have always enjoyed writing, and taking photos and longed to make a living doing so. However, writing and photograpy don't pay very well starting out and they take quite a bit of time and resources to build a career off of. So I had to get creative which is my nature :). 

I have learned some web development languages such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and of course SQL a language that communicates with databases.
I also learned how to use github and I am now in the process of combining two worlds that I never new could exist together. I have gained technical skills that will allow me to share my writing on those things that interest me from technical writing, creative writing and photography. I have always enjoyed taking pictures of every thing, person and place since I was a young child. I think life is so bueatiful and I am in awe that a camera can capture and freeze moments in time.

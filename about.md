# Professional Bio

I currtently hold the position as a Mental Health Data Analyst at A Better Way Inc.(ABW). For the past 3 years, I've had the pleasure of contributing to ABW’s mission by working with cross-functional teams creating dashboards that improve the quality of our services and data entry into our Electronic Health Record (EHR). I create reports using the data analysis platform Sisense, which integrates advanced data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling tools. Such reports provide programs with real-time monitoring of contract requirements, deliverables, and the impact our services have on clients. In addition to managing our EHR as the system administrator providing troubleshooting support, the creation and maintance of all user accounts within the system, I was responsible for tracking and processing all medical billing which provided the necessary revenue needed to continue serving children and families.

My Impact On:

Clinical Staff is improved accuracy of their workflow. I created reports that displayed the status of forms and progress notes that were required before behavioral health services could be rendered. such reports prevented loss of valuable time and revenue.

Mental Health Coordinators was improving the quality, consistency and maintenance of the client data 
entered into the EHR system. The reports generated allowed coordinators to track clients missing data which improved the client registration timeline, therefore speeding up the time it takes a client to receive services and helped the program meet contract quality assurance requirements. 

Program Directors improved their ability to track monthly revenue, staff productivity and training needs.

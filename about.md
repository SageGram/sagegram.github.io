# Professional Bio

My name is Taisa Grant, I work for A Better Way Inc (ABW), a non-profit organization that has a profound impact on people's lives providing comprehensive social services in behavioral health, foster care & adoption, family strengthening, and parent advocacy for children and families. 

As the Mental Health Data Analyst, I've had the pleasure of contributing to the positive impact ABW has on the lives of the communities we serve. I work very closely with our program directors, supervisors, clinical staff, and mental health coordinators. I create dashboards that improve and inform the quality of our services and data entry into our Electronic Health Record (EHR). I create reports using the data analysis platform Sisense, which integrates advanced data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling tools. Such reports provide programs with real-time monitoring of contract requirements, deliverables, and the impact our services have on clients. In addition to managing our EHR system and all user accounts within the system, I was responsible for tracking and processing all medical billing which provided the necessary revenue needed to continue serving children and families.

My Impact On:

Clinical Staff is improved accuracy of their workflow. I created reports that displayed the status of forms and progress notes that were required before behavioral health services could be rendered. This report prevented loss of valuable time and revenue.

Mental Health Coordinators was improving the quality, consistency and maintenance of the client data 
entered into the EHR system. The reports generated allowed coordinators to track clients missing data which improved the client registration timeline, therefore speeding up the time it takes a client to receive services and helped the program meet contract quality assurance requirements. 

Program Directors improved their ability to track monthly revenue, staff productivity and training needs.

I welcome the opportunity to discuss with you how my prior work experience has prepared me to be an impactful contributor and leader in your organization.

### The film Black Panther has proved to be a huge level up in terms of representation. 
In a time where representation or the lack of representation is a huge topic of interest, it was hard not to be inspired, activated and motivated by the wonderful characters of the Black Panther Film. I feel like Black Panther gave us everything we are fighting for, as black women, men and people of color and or those that would like to get as close to a utopian society as possible.

### Shuriâ€™s technical innovations,intellect and her commitment to problem solving made her invaluable.
Shuri figured out countless times how to harness the power of Vibranium and weaponized the gear she created. Throughout the film there was an overtone of celebration of her brilliant mind and her creativity. She had the knowledge necessary to create resources for the black panther that not only helped him reign victorious over all his advisories; the gear she created saved his life and others over and over again. She was a major player in the fight to maintain the peace that the people of Wakanda had grown accustomed to.

### The comedian DL Hughley made a thought provoking statement during his most recent interview with the Breakfast club. 
DL Hughley said that black folks wanted to be validated so bad, that we looked to Wakanda for this validation when all we had to do is look to Africa.

I kinda agree, Africa is a continent rich in minerals and precious stones. It is also home to pyramids, that to this day there is dispute regarding how they were constructed. I would like to investigate this further one day. I believe the elements that made the film black panther wonderful and empowering truly exist or existed in Africa and we don't have to look too or wait for a film to represent our greatness to feel special or even be moved to do great things. If we look into our ancestry and in our current reality, we will find all that we need to know about our capabilities.

### Technology is shaping the world around us.
It is time that Black Women, Black Men and all underrepresented, disadvantage, disregarded people become active and even leaders in creating technology, in a major way, no more tokens. It is imperative that we play a major role in what is being created. It is imperative that we assist in the creation of technological advances that work toward eliminating disparities and inhumane societal norms. This is to guarantee our best interest is among the goals. Finally, more and more jobs available today require some level of technical skill and this will only increase, we really have no choice but to guarantee a seat at the table. Or be left to exist picking up the scraps thrown to us. As we see that is no way for our next 7 generations to exist.

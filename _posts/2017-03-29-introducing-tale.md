I started my day in the early hours of the morning, making my way to the Oakland Airport.
The purpose of the this trip was to attend [Writethedocs](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2018/). This particular conferenece brings together people who write the docs, "from  Programmers, Tech Writers, Support, Designers, Developer Advocates, and more".

 * I was feeling deary and cloudy consumed by symptoms of a cold, while the city was vibrant and bright and pulsing with high frequency energy.


My seat vibrated the entire flig/ht. The sky's was clear and the snowing mountain top peaks were visible
I landed into portland and to my surprise it's a sunny humid tropical weather kind of day.
 No breeze and temperature reaching 70 degrees. I took a walk from my hotell to the waterfront where I found a full on carnival with rides and the who shabang due the cinco de mayo celebration. 
The portland sunday market was in full affect aswells. 

There was live music,
water fountain was turned on as little one ran about running  in our playfully trying to avoid tko water shooting from out the ground. 
There were all types of goods for sale mostly handmade goods such as paintings, clothing jewelry etc. 
The vibe was happy and welcoming. 
Diverse community well entrenched in mexican culture
Looks like I landed on a great day.

Boats were in the bay
All sorts of bikes were on the walkways form for seaters, tricycles and the regular city rentals
Voodoo doughnut had a long line out the door as promised.
Walked the the cobblestone street on**** watching at the city train passed by
Feels like I got a glimpse into a typical sunny sunday in portland.
Form the lyft driver who picked me up from the airport and eagerly pointed out the beautiful bridges of the city and pointed me in the direction of the happening part of downtown.
To the musicians with his guitar on the waterfront welomcing me in town as he rapped up his first day of writing songs on the spot for interested passer buyers. 
Portland is a beautiful city full of development and a homeless challenge that alsot of american cities face. 
Thank you portland for the wonderful welcome. Itâ€™s a big city skyscraping building 
Development and food shack spread out through downtown.
Definitely can see the not so blend of the old and the new.

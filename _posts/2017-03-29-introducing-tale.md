I started my day in the early hours of the morning, making my way to the Oakland Airport. The purpose of this trip was to attend [Writethedocs](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2018/). This particular conference brings together people who write the docs, "from  Programmers, Tech Writers, Support, Designers, Developer Advocates, and more".

On a small jet engine plane, I was feeling deary and cloudy consumed by symptoms of a cold. My seat vibrated the entire flight. The sky was clear I enjoyed a beautiful view of mountain peaks covered in snow. I attempted to get an estimate of the planes speed by searching out the furthest mountain peak and timing how long it took the plane to past it. Mesmerized by a beautiful skyline before I knew it the plane landed in Portland and to my surprise, it was a sunny, humid, tropical weather, kind of day.

There was no breeze and temperature reached well above 70 degrees. This was a huge change from the previous year, where it was raining and hailing. I was really under the weather but the sun is so healing. I could resist the blue clear sky and beaming rays of sunlight the day were barely unfolding when I arrived. I took a walk from my hotel to the waterfront where I found a full-on carnival with rides and the who shebang due to the Cinco de Mayo celebration. 

The Portland Sunday market was in full effect as well. There was live music, water fountain was turned on as little one ran about running  in our playfully trying to avoid the water shooting from out the ground. There were all types of goods for sale mostly handmade goods such as paintings, clothing jewelry etc. The vibe was happy and welcoming. Diverse community well entrenched in Mexican culture
Looks like I landed on a great day. Boats were in the bay All sorts of bikes were on the walkways form for seaters, tricycles and the regular city rentals Voodoo doughnut had a long line out the door as promised. Walked the cobblestone street on**** watching at the city train passed by Feels like I got a glimpse into a typical sunny Sunday in Portland.
Form the lyft driver who picked me up from the airport and eagerly pointed out the beautiful bridges of the city and pointed me in the direction of the happening part of downtown. To the musicians with his guitar on the waterfront welcoming me in town as he wrapped up his first day of writing songs on the spot for interested passer buyers. Portland is a beautiful city full of development and a homeless challenge that alsot of american cities face. Thank you portland for the wonderful welcome. Itâ€™s a big city skyscraping building 
Development and food shack spread out through downtown. Definitely can see the not so blend of the old and the new.
